# Tensor Dimensions Exploration

This project helps you understand different types of tensors using Python and PyTorch:

- **1-D Tensor**
- **2-D Tensor (Matrix)**
- **3-D Tensor**
- **n-D Tensor**

## How to Use

Run the Python script provided in this repository to explore and visualize tensor structures in various dimensions.  
You'll get a clear idea of how tensors behave and are represented in code.

```bash
tensor.ipynb
